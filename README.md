## 📖 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Banner Display:**

   - The tool uses `pyfiglet` to render the main banner "H9A" in large ASCII art with a sub-name below it.

2. **Calculation Logic:**

   - The tool calculates:
     - **Ones Place:** Counts how many times 9 appears as the last digit (e.g., 9, 19, 29, ...).
     - **Tens Place:** Counts how many times 9 appears in the tens place (e.g., 90, 91, 92, ...).
   - Combines both counts for the total.

3. **Detailed Explanation:**

   - Prints a breakdown of each step and explains how the total was derived.

4. **Result Display:**

   - Finally, the tool displays the total count of 9s found in the range 1 to 100.

## 🧮 Example Output

Here is an example of how the tool runs:

```bash
H9A
How Many 9 In 1 to 100

Calculating step by step...

Step 2: 9 appears 10 times in the ones place.
Step 3: 9 appears 9 times in the tens place.
Step 4: Total occurrences of 9 = 19.

Explanation:
1. In the ones place: The digit 9 appears in numbers like 9, 19, 29, ..., 99.
2. In the tens place: The digit 9 appears in numbers like 90, 91, 92, ..., 99.
3. Total occurrences are calculated by adding these together.

Final Result: In the range 1 to 100, the digit '9' appears 19 times!
```
